Project Proposal

Your first assignment is to properly describe and plan out your project deciding what you will offer. The proposal needs to:

    Fully outline the scope of what you will accomplish
    How the work will be split between team members
    What you will have completed (and submitted) by the project milestone


Only one proposal submission is required per team.





For our project, we want to build a sports betting tracker to allow user to track their spendings and earnings. The user can input their bets and earnings and it will display a chart showing trends. 

  The website will have an intro page showing off the useful links that a user can access. They will be able to register and the data will be stored in a log where they can log-in and log-out. The 
user will then have access to all links that is useful to sports, including a link to track spendings and earnings. We plan to use some data science to make the graph nice and easy to read. Admin 
privieges include access to data gathering by using some elements from lab 4 and data statistics that can track data from all users.
